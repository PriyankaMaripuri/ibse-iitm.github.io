Driver genes are defined as genes that help in progression of cancer by giving the cell the ability to divide indefinitely. These genes can further be divided into tumour suppressor genes(TSG) and oncogenes(OG) based on function. Depending on whether driver genes, while functioning normally, help suppress or promote tumour development, the mutation type patterns vary between the two. Thus, identification of driver genes by classifying into these 2 sub-classes may give better results.
The objective is to integrate multiple omic data to get better classification power and identify low potency driver genes by classifying them into TSG and OG.
