Quantitative Systems Pharmacology models are  mostly grey box mathematical models that try to capture the interaction between drug and the physiology at a systems level using both knowledge of biology and empirical data. This project attempts  to address the issues of modeling by systematic investigation employing system identification theory as prime tool.
