Metabolic networks tend to exhibit plasticity with respect to the growth environments. We aim to understand the role of the various biochemical reactions in metabolic plasticity and also deciphering the metabolic “constraints” underlying growth and survival in various environments. We seek to comprehend the above through theoretical simulations using validated genome-scale metabolic models of organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
