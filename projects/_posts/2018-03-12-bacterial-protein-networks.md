Building biological networks for specific biological functionalities is one of the major problems of synthetic biology. Given the complexity and the diverse nature of biology, it is always challenging to establish a mapping between the model structure space to function space. Previous efforts in this area have attempted a brute force method exploring the entire topology parameter space. On the contrary, this project strives to build a systematic procedure inspired by LTI systems theory to obtain the exact mapping between the topology and its functionality. The entire problem is set up as a design-oriented problem as against involving brute force method. The necessary conditions for the functionality are translated to corresponding LTI system requirements.  Subsequently, a structure-specific optimization problem is performed to obtain robust parameter space.
