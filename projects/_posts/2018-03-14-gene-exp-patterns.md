A common approach towards the study of the biological evolution is through whole genome sequence comparisons. Although this approach provides the overall history of life, it remains inadequate while describing the phenotypic divergence observed between closely related species. Changes in gene expression has been thought to underlie many of these phenotypic differences between species and hallmarking the tissue specific phenotypes. Transcriptome data from multiple tissues and species provides an opportunity to investigate genes based on their differential expression patterns in tissue evolution. In this study, we used transcriptome data of 6 tissues from 10 species, viz. human, gorilla, orangutan, chimpanzee, bonobo, macaque, mouse, opossum, platypus and chicken (evolutionary out-group for mammals) to obtain gene expression patterns with divergence time from humans as longitudinal constraint. We observed that genes involved in similar biological processes show similar patterns and cluster together in tissues, which might help us unmask the genetic causes that underlie the phenotypic divergence between species.
