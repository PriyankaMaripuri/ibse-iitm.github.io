Evolution of expression profiles was studied using data generated by Brawand et al. (2011). The data contains RNA sequencing data from 6 tissues across 10 species constituting 132 samples in total. Expression levels of 5320 orthologous genes across all species were considered for this analysis. The aim of the analysis was to identify set of genes which had the greatest influence on the evolution of expression of profiles.Analysis of the data revealed that multiple gene subsets could be identified with the ability to differentiate between tissues. Since expression of genes are correlated, feature selection picks any one of these correlated genes.
