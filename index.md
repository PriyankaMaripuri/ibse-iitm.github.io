## Welcome!
The Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE) at IIT Madras seeks to interface the existing expertise in data analytics at IIT Madras with biological data, and to build infrastructure and capabilities for the analysis of biological big data, which arise out of the various scales of biological organisation. 

### Mission and Vision
IBSE is an interdisciplinary group dedicated to developing approaches and algorithms integrating multi-dimensional multi-scale data in complex biological systems to build predictive models of cells and populations. 

In doing so, we enhance fundamental understanding of biological systems and diseases and provide the knowledge needed to empower personalised medicine.
