I have completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from SRM College of Engineering and Management, Lucknow and M.Tech from BIT Mesra, Ranchi.  My work majorly focusses on machine learning applications to biological data. I have worked on predicting the efficacy of the combination of drugs given the genomic data of human cancer cell-line. Currently. I am trying to understand the topological structure of the human genome interactome and to predict disease relevant modules.
