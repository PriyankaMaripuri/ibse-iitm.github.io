I did my undergraduate in Biotechnology and Genetics from Loyola Academy, Hyderabad and MSc in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Pondicherry University, Pondicherry. After my MSc, I worked for 6 months as a JRF in IIT Hyderabad on the structural aspects of G quadruplexes. Currently, I am doing my PhD under Dr Himanshu Sinha, and my research is focussed on Ribosomal protein variants and their effects on phenotype.
