Iâ€™m a PhD student at the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory. My area of research is Systems Biology with a special focus on modelling and engineering microbial communities, through in silico simulations and wet lab experiments. My study is aimed at leveraging the joint metabolic capabilities of microorganisms for the overproduction of commercially important metabolites. The main questions which I try to address are:

Are there any basic principles behind organisms staying together in a community?
What is the type of interaction involved in establishing a stable community?
Can we use modelling to tap the potential of microbial consortia?
