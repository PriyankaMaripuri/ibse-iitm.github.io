I am interested in decoding the true wealth of data the human genome carries, using computational techniques. I am a huge fan of sci-fi novels (Asimov being my favorite) and an ardent supporter of Sourav Ganguly. Some of my other interests include geopolitics and watching documentaries. I am often intrigued by the question, "Why is there something, rather than nothing".
