I have worked on 'Building a model & probiotic system to tackle Antibiotic Resistance', a synthetic biology project as part of iGem'15 team from IIT Madras. During my summer internship, I worked on 'Mining potentially novel cellulase gene from rumen meta-genome of jafrabadi buffalo'. I am currently working on 'Evolutionary analysis gene expression patterns in mammalian organs', as part of his final year project under guidance of Prof. Himanshu Sinha, Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat & Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences.
