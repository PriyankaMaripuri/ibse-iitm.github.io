Currently, I am working on finding design principles for important biological functionalities such as adaptation, oscillation. I take a lot of interest in understanding topological geometry, how the complex structures in nature came about. I am also an avid reader of philosophy. I passionately follow football and I am a die-hard fan of Lionel Messi.
