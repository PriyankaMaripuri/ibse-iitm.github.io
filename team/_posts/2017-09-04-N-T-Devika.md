I currently look into the metabolism of infant gut microbe using constraint-based genome-scale model leading to its importance in human health and disease and in a variety of industrial applications.
My Phd work at Anna University focused on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an enzyme which promote release of nitric acid in endothelium. Employing computational approaches, my doctoral dissertation brings in detail the mechanochemical signal transduction pathway, structural cues in phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events and the protein interaction underlying the signalling events.
