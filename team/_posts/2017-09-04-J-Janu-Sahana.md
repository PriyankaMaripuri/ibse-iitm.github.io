I'm currently in the final year of Dual degree (B.Tech. & M.Tech.) in Biological Engineering. I've worked on formulating an efficient drug delivery system using BSA nanoparticles that is convenient, localized and biocompatible and studied its drug release kinetics. I've also developed an algorithm to superpose three dimensional structures of multiple proteins, with a reduced computational complexity as compared to the existing algorithms. I'm currently working on longitudinal analysis of gene expression data across evolution, under the guidance of Prof. Himanshu Sinha, IIT Madras.
