My interests lie on the interface of Physics and Biology. It intrigues me as to how one can use ideas from Statistical Physics, Non-linear dynamics etc. to get quantitative and predictive insights into biological phenomena occurring at various length and time-scales. More recently, I have been looking at the topological determinants of modularity in gene regulatory networks.
