I obtained my Masters in Biotechnology from Osmania University, Hyderabad. I worked at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad as a Research assistant, on the project entitled "Analysis of generation of memory B lymphocytes" and also carried out host-pathogen interaction studies in Leishmania donavani. Presently, I am pursuing my Ph.D, under Dr. Himanshu Sinha, at Indian Institute of Technology - Madras, to understand the regulatory role of specialised ribosomes using yeast as a model system.
