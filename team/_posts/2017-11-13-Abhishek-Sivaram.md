I am a graduate of Chemical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Having completed my Bachelors and Masters (Dual degree) in Chemical Engineering, I am currently pursuing my Doctoral studies in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University in the City of New York. 

In IBSE, I worked on Extraction of Mutational Signatures in Cancer Genomes, as a part of my Dual Degree Project. The project worked at an intersection of Systems Engineering and Genomics, and involved using Systems Theory to isolate mutational signatures which are common to all cancerous tissues. 

My current research involves application of Systems Theory to complex, adaptive, networked, goal-driven systems which produce an emergent behavior. Such emergent behaviors are seen in flocking of birds, stock market dynamics, and even consciousness in brain.
