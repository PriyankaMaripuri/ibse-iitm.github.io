I did my B.Tech(Hons.) in Biotechnology from SASTRA University, then worked as systems engineer in TCS for 3 years. I pursued my studies with an M.Tech in Biopharmaceutical Technology from Anna University. I am currently doing my PhD in Computational Systems Biology. My research work mainly focuses on understanding the evolutionary aspects in metabolism.
