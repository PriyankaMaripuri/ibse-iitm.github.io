I graduated from IIT Madras with a B.Tech and M.Tech in Chemical Engineering and am currently pursuing my doctorate in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. In the past, I have worked on projects in the field of systems biology- including analyzing the role of diet and gut microbiota in autism, kinetic modeling of the mechanism of an anticancer drug and modeling a microbial photosynthetic fuel cell. I also pursued a minor in energy technology and worked on modeling nano-morphologies for efficient polymer solar cells. My goal is to harness computational engineering to solve challenging problems in the domain of life sciences and sustainable energy.
