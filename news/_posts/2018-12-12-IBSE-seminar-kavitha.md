IBSE is very pleased to introduce you all to our guest speaker Dr. Kavita Jain. 
Asbtract of her talk: In an influential essay, evolutionary biologist Theo Dobzhansky stated that “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution”. Indeed, evolution shapes diversity at all levels of biological organization, ranging from cells to species. Population genetics and quantitative genetics have been used for over a century to describe biological evolution at genetic and phenotypic level, respectively. But there has been little effort to connect these two levels. In this talk, I will describe a bottom-up approach to describe rapid adaptation dynamics of a phenotype with an explicit reference to the underlying genetics.
