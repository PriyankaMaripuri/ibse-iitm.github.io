IBSE is very pleased to introduce you all to our guest speaker Mr. Srikiran Chandrasekaran. The title of his presentation will be: "Bayesian optimization for fitting dynamical systems in environmental engineering". Srikiran Chandrasekaran graduated from IIT Madras with a B. Tech in Biotechnology in 2015. Currently, He is a PhD candidate in the Mathematical, Computational and Systems Biology programme at the University of California, Irvine in the lab of Prof. Sunny Jiang. 

In light of limited water resources, wastewater is being used for agricultural and recreational purposes. Complete purification of wastewater is not economical and the microbial risk posed by reuse must be understood to manage resources optimally. The overarching goal of his research is to develop mathematical models that enable better prediction and understanding of microbial risk from wastewater reuse.
