IBSE is very pleased to introduce you all to our guest speaker Dr Nathan Bachmann from University of Sydney. He is currently working with Dr. Sivaraman at National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT). Dr. Nathan and Dr. Sivaraman are working on whole-genome sequencing of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis samples. IBSE is very excited to explore potential collaborations with Dr. Nathan's group at University of Sydney and NIRT on topics ranging from evolution of drug resistance to how social networks drive spread of Tuberculosis infection.
