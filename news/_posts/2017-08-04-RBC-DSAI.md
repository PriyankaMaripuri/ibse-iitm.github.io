Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions (RBEI) and IIT Madras today signed an MoU for establishing the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI). RBC-DSAI will undertake foundational research in various areas of AI and Data Science. 

IBSE / systems biology research has been a strong _vertical_ at the erstwhile Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Data Sciences (ILDS); we hope this will give further fillip to IBSE activities!
