The **Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE)** at IIT Madras seeks to interface the existing expertise in **data analytics** at IIT Madras with **biological data**, and to build infrastructure and capabilities for the **analysis of biological big data**, which arise out of the various scales of biological organisation. 

IBSE is an interdisciplinary group dedicated to developing approaches and algorithms integrating multi-dimensional multi-scale data in complex biological systems to build predictive models of cells and populations. 

In doing so, we enhance fundamental **understanding of biological systems and diseases** and provide the knowledge needed to empower **personalised medicine**.
