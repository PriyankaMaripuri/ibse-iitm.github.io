# Mission

The **Initiative for Biological Systems Engineering (IBSE)** at IIT Madras is an interdisciplinary group dedicated to pioneering innovative approaches and algorithms that integrate multi-dimensional data across scales, to understand, predict and manipulate complex biological systems. In so doing, we aim not only to advance fundamental understanding of cells and their interactions as populations forming complex organs but also to empower personalised medicine.
