# Join Us!

We encourage faculty to initiate collaborations with IBSE faculty, as well as interested graduate and 
undergraduate students to reach out to the IBSE faculty / students, to initiate projects. 

### IBSE Interdisciplinary MS/PhD Programme

In December 2017, we plan to admit interdisciplinary MS/PhD students to the IBSE programme.

### IIT Madras Regular MS/PhD Programme

IIT Madras accepts MS/PhD applications all year round now, and you can choose to work with IBSE faculty, based on your interests.

### Dual Degree / Undergraduate Projects

IBSE already hosts several undergraduate / dual degree projects. Feel free to reach out to any of the IBSE faculty for possible projects.
